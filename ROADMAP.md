## Project Context
This is a hands-on learning and product development project where Claude is teaching Bernard (who last coded in 2011) modern web development while simultaneously building a production-ready AI Marketing & Sales Automation Platform. The goal is to create a real product that Bernard can immediately start selling to clients in Nairobi and its environs.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a product ready for the Kenyan market

## The REAL Value Proposition
**"We don't just answer questions - we FIND customers, NURTURE them, and CLOSE sales while you sleep"**

This platform is NOT just a chatbot. It's a complete customer acquisition machine that:
1. **FINDS** customers through local SEO, social media, and Google Ads
2. **ENGAGES** them with AI across WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram
3. **NURTURES** leads with automated campaigns and follow-ups
4. **CONVERTS** with timely offers and easy booking/ordering
5. **RETAINS** through loyalty programs and reorder reminders

    // Groq for real-time (<1 second)
    return await groq.chat(task);
  } else if (task.type === 'content' || task.type === 'analysis') {
    // Gemini for quality content
    return await gemini.generateContent(task);

    - Speaks to local ${business.target} customers
    - Highlights: ${business.todaySpecial}

  `;
  
  return await gemini.generateContent(prompt);
};
```

**3. Real-time Conversation Handling**

// Groq handles urgent conversations
const handleLiveChat = async (message, context) => {
  // Price haggling detection
  if (isPriceInquiry(message)) {
    return await groq.negotiate({
      customerOffer: extractPrice(message),
      businessRules: context.pricingRules,
      culturalContext: 'kenyan-haggling'
    });
  }
  
  // General urgent inquiry
  return await groq.respond(message, context);
};
```

  // Analyze current performance
  const analysis = await gemini.analyze({
    metrics: business.currentMetrics,
