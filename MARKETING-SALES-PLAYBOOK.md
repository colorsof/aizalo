def negotiate_price(asking_price, customer_offer, minimum_acceptable):
    # First offer - show flexibility but maintain value
    if customer_offer < minimum_acceptable * 0.9:
        return f"I appreciate your offer, but the best I can do is {minimum_acceptable * 1.05}"
    
    # Second round - meet halfway
    elif customer_offer < asking_price * 0.85:
        middle = (customer_offer + asking_price) / 2
        return f"Let's meet halfway at {middle}. Fair?"
    
    # Close the deal
    else:
        return f"You drive a hard bargain! {customer_offer} it is. When can you collect?"
```

**Urgency Creators**
