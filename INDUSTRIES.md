## Universal Features for All Industries

### Price Negotiation Framework
```javascript
// AI Model Selection for Haggling
const handlePriceNegotiation = async (customerMessage, context) => {
  // Use Groq for real-time price haggling (<1 second response)
  if (isUrgentPriceInquiry(customerMessage)) {
    return await groqService.negotiate(customerMessage, context);
  }
  
  // Use Gemini for complex negotiations or analysis
  return await geminiService.generateContent('price-negotiation', context);
};

// Haggling Logic (handled by AI)
if (customerOffer < minimumPrice) {
  response = "I appreciate your offer, but the lowest I can go is [minimumPrice + 5%]"
} else if (customerOffer < targetPrice) {
  response = "I can meet you halfway at [average of offer and target]"
} else {
  response = "Deal! Let's proceed with your order at [customerOffer]"
}
```

### Cultural Considerations
- Always expect negotiation (it's cultural)
- Build relationship before pushing sale
- Offer payment plans when sensing price resistance
- Use social proof ("Many customers from [area] buy this")
- Time-based urgency works ("This price valid today only")

### Success Patterns
1. **Quick Response** - Groq for <1 second, Gemini for <3 seconds
2. **Friendly Tone** - Professional but warm (both AIs trained for this)
3. **Price Flexibility** - Always have negotiation room
4. **Local Knowledge** - Mention nearby landmarks
5. **Follow-up** - Gemini plans intelligent follow-ups

### AI Usage by Industry
- **High-urgency industries** (Hardware, Real Estate): More Groq usage (~10%)
- **Content-heavy industries** (Hotels, Restaurants): Mostly Gemini (~98%)
- **All industries**: Gemini handles 95% overall, Groq only for urgent real-time
